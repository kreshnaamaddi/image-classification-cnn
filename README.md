# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 **32x32 color images** categorized into **10 different classes**, including airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more. The model is trained to recognize these objects and predict their respective classes with high accuracy.

## Dataset
- **Name:** CIFAR-10
- **Size:** 60,000 images (50,000 training, 10,000 testing)
- **Categories:** Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck
- **Shape:** 32x32 pixels, RGB color (3 channels)
- **Source:** [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

## Project Workflow
1. **Load CIFAR-10 dataset** into training and testing sets.
2. **Preprocess the data** by normalizing pixel values and reshaping if necessary.
3. **Build a CNN model** using multiple layers, including convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
4. **Compile and train the model** using an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
5. **Evaluate model performance** on the test dataset.
6. **Visualize model accuracy and loss trends** using Matplotlib.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts features using multiple filters.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduces spatial dimensions while retaining important features.
- **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers**: Processes extracted features for classification.
- **Softmax Output Layer**: Predicts probabilities for each class.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the following command to execute the model training and evaluation:
```bash
python cnn_model.py
```

## Results & Analysis
- The model achieves a reasonable accuracy on the test set.
- Training accuracy and loss curves indicate how well the model is learning.
- Further improvements can be made by using data augmentation, dropout layers, or hyperparameter tuning.

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with deeper architectures like ResNet or VGG.
- Implement data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
- Use transfer learning with pre-trained models to boost performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how a CNN can be effectively trained for **image classification tasks**. The CIFAR-10 dataset provides a challenging yet manageable problem to explore deep learning concepts and improve model performance through iterative enhancements.
